FlowChart is a vector drawing application for Windows. It provides
features for drawing basic shapes, text, images, and lines. Users 
must draw lines to connect to each other. It supports grouping,
multiple selection, alignment, sizing, nudging, layers, zoom.

There are many bugs in the program still! SAVE OFTEN! Files are saved
as the .FLC extension ("FLowChart"). Do not confuse these files
with the animation file format.

Requires:

Microsoft Visual Basic 6 runtime
Microsoft Word 2007 for spell checker
